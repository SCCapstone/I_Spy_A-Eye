          Simple, swift, and straightforward. I Spy Shopper makes it easy to
          find the products you need. To find your products, enter relevant
          keywords such as product type or brand into the search bar, click
          'Search', and let the fuzzy word matching do the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking for the cheapest products, or maybe just products from the
          U.S. on a given page of results? Apply one or more of the many
          filtering and sorting options and see the results update to fit your
          needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you know you've entered the right keywords but can't find what
          you're looking for, don't worry. Many searches will return several
          pages of results that you can sift through by using the navigation
          buttons just below the search results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've found what you're looking for, you can directly add that
          item to your cart from the search results. If you'd want to know more
          about an item, then simply click on the product's card--you'll be
          notified when it's selected--and then click the 'Details' button below
          the 'Search' button; that'll take you to that product's detail
          page[insert possible hyperlink to the Details part of the website]."
        </p>

        <h3>Settings Screen</h3>
        <center>
          <a href="images/settingsscreen1.png"
            ><img
              src="images/settingsscreen1.png"
              alt="Screenshot of the settings screen."
          /></a>
          <a href="images/settingsscreen2.png"
            ><img
              src="images/settingsscreen2.png"
              alt="Screenshot of the settings screen."
          /></a>
        </center>
        <p>
          Access the settings screen by using the navigation bar at the bottom
          of the app and clicking the cog wheel. If you haven't created an
          account and/or signed in yet, you'll need to do so before being able
          to access your settings. Once there, you can see who you're currently
          signed in as, as well as the current store you're ordering products
          from near the top of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can conveniently change account information such as delivery
          address, billing information, and current store at any time to suit
          your needs. If you want to order groceries on behalf of someone else,
          for example, it's easy to change the delivery address to do so. You
          can also select how many products to view on each page by clicking on
          the option your prefer and hitting the 'Save Button'. Once you're
          done, you may sign out of your account here as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, if you need a refresher video on how to use the app, you can
          access the tutorial from the bottom of the settings screen.

        <h3>Signup Screen</h3>
        <center>
          <a href="images/signupscreen.png"
            ><img
              src="images/signupscreen.png"
              alt="Screenshot of the signup screen."
          /></a>
        </center>
        <p>
          The sign up screen is straight forward and elegant. To promote cyber
          safety, all accounts must be created with passwords that would be
          challenging for hackers to decrypt.

        <h3>Login Screen</h3>
        <center>
          <a href="images/loginscreen.png"
            ><img
              src="images/loginscreen.png"
              alt="Screenshot of the login screen."
          /></a>
        </center>
        <p>
          The login screen is where your shopping journey begins. Here you can
          go to the sign up screen, watch a tutorial on how to use the app,
          continue without signing in, and of course log in to your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuing without signing in is a way to get a feel for the app so
          you can decide whether or not creating an account is right for you.
          You can't make purchases or change settings if you do not sign in
          however.
